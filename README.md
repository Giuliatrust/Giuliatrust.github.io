Giulia Trust is an inclusion first initiative created by a neurodivergent founder to support neurodivergent people navigating bureaucratic systems, care structures, and institutions not designed for cognitive difference. Inspired by lived experience and dementia care, the Trust promotes dignity, accessibility, advocacy, and humane systems.
